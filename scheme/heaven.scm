;; Let's begin

;; 1. Intro
(heaven-log 1 "Hello.")
(canvas-sleep 2)
(heaven-log-all)

;; 2. Create a ship
(heaven-create 'ship)
(heaven-log-all)

;; 3. Enter the ship and create things therein
(heaven-enter 'ship)
(heaven-create 'table)
(heaven-create 'computer)
(heaven-log-all)

;; 4. Become a program and enter the computer
(heaven-become 'program)
(heaven-enter 'computer)
(heaven-log-all)

;; 5. Leave the computer
(heaven-leave)
(heaven-log-all)
(heaven-log 5 "You're now free.")


;; You can now interact with the REPL
;; E.g. type:
;; (heaven-become 'human)
;; (heaven-log-all)
